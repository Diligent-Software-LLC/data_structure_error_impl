# DataStructureErrorImpl

Implements and subclasses the DataStructureError
class interface. There are three public instance methods, one private instance
method, and two helper methods.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'data_structure_error_impl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install data_structure_error_impl

## Usage

### Public instance methods
The three public instance methods are the constructor, the message(), and raise_exception(data_structure_type).

#### initialize(message_argument = nil)
The constructor. The message defaults the DEFAULT_MESSAGE.

#### message()

Getter method. Gets and returns the message attribute.

#### raise_exception(data_structure_type)

In the case the argument is a data object or an unacceptable data structure, raises. Takes an unknown type object.

### Private instance methods
The private instance method is the message=(explanation).

#### message=(explanation)



### Helper methods
The two helper methods are choose(explanation), and raise?(presumed_acceptable).

#### choose(explanation)

#### raise?(presumed_acceptable)
